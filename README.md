# Button-Clicker-App
This Android program helped me learn the basics of Kotlin, including the constraint layout,
layout designer, activity lifecycle, and Logcat pane.

Log.d() functions were implemented to see when/where certain widgets/actions called
the different callbacks. Furthermore, this concept was driven home when program lost
its current data in portrait mode if the user turned it into landscape mode. Thus, we called the
onSaveInstanceState() and onRestoreInstanceState() functions.

Experienced some issues with the git master branch, but the following links were helpful in resolving those issues.
